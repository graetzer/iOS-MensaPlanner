# Description #
SGViewPager contains custom UIViewController container, that display the content of child viewcontroller's in a paged scrollview.
There are three implemenations, but the only recent one is [https://github.com/graetzer/SGViewPager/blob/master/SGTabbedPager.swift](SGTabbedPager)
It is designed to look like the tabs in the android ActionBar and works really well for certain use cases.
You can watch a [Demo video on youtube](http://youtu.be/IgrEA3FjGfs)
It's written in swift and should be easy to customize.

For example code look at my [MealPlanner App](https://github.com/graetzer/iOS-MensaPlanner)

-------------------------

There are two more implementations, but they are not very recent. You will likely find the look outdated.
-  SGAnnotatedPagerController: Shows the title of child viewcontroller's at the top, slightly similar to the stream view in the Google+ App

-  SGViewPagerController: Display a UIPageControl at the bottom of the page

# How to use these in your own project #
Just copy either the SGAnnotatedPagerController.* files or the SGViewPagerController.* files in your XCode project.
You don't have to load the viewcontrollers from a xib or a storyboard file, just make sure that the view
has an appropriate size if you use a UINavigationController (416px) or a UITabBarController(411px).

# Example code #
	SGAnnotatedPagerController *annotated = [[SGAnnotatedPagerController alloc]initWithNibName:@"SGAnnotatedPagerController" bundle:nil];
	annotated.title = @"TitleControl";
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
 	   SGExampleController *ec = [[SGExampleController alloc] init];
	    ec.title = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Nr. %d", i+1];
	    [annotated addPage:ec];
	}
	self.window.rootViewController = annotated;
	// ...


For detailed example code look in the SGAppDelegate.m file in the example project
